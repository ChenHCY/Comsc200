Describe the Homework:

Basic Elevator Implementation by used C++ GUI.

Approach:

I created 5 part class(h.file, cpp.file): the elevator, the rider, the floor, the panel, the building, and the main part file.

The Result:

● Implemented the C++ GUI data structure and build the Elevator Simulation System. 
● Read, analyzed, and implemented people enter the elevator, or leave the elevator of the elevator move locus. 
● Successfully demonstrated the C++ GUI to build a complex image Simulation system
